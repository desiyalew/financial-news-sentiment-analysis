Quantitative Analysis Report
This report summarizes the quantitative analysis performed on a portfolio of stocks, as outlined in the provided Jupyter Notebook (Quant_Analysis_Notebook.ipynb) and the associated Python module (quant_analysis_module.py). The analysis includes loading historical stock data, applying technical indicators, visualizing key metrics, and performing portfolio optimization. Below are the key findings and results.

1. Overview
The analysis focuses on seven major technology stocks: AAPL, AMZN, GOOG, META, MSFT, NVDA, and TSLA. Historical stock data was loaded from CSV files located in the ../data/yfinance_data/ directory. The analysis covers the period from January 1, 2023, to January 1, 2024. Key tasks included:

Loading and preprocessing stock data.
Applying technical analysis indicators (SMA, RSI, MACD).
Visualizing stock price trends and indicators.
Calculating portfolio weights and performance metrics.
Exporting results for further analysis.


2. Data Loading and Preprocessing
2.1 Data Sources
Historical stock data for each ticker was loaded from CSV files using the load_stock_data function. The data includes columns such as Open, High, Low, Close, Adj Close, Volume, Dividends, and Stock Splits. The number of rows for each stock's dataset is as follows:

AAPL: 10,998 rows
AMZN: 6,846 rows
GOOG: 5,020 rows
META: 2,926 rows
MSFT: 9,672 rows
NVDA: 6,421 rows
TSLA: 3,545 rows

2.2 Preprocessing

The Date column was parsed as a datetime object and set as the index.
Data was sorted by date to ensure chronological order.
Technical indicators were applied using the apply_ta_indicators function from the quant_analysis_module.


3. Technical Analysis
Technical indicators were calculated for each stock to analyze price trends and momentum. The following indicators were computed:

Simple Moving Averages (SMA):
20-day SMA (SMA_20)
50-day SMA (SMA_50)


Relative Strength Index (RSI): 14-day RSI to identify overbought (>70) or oversold (<30) conditions.
Moving Average Convergence Divergence (MACD):
MACD line (12-day EMA - 26-day EMA)
Signal line (9-day EMA of MACD)
Histogram (MACD - Signal)



3.1 Visualization
The visualize_indicators function generated three plots for each stock:

Stock Price with SMA: Displays the closing price alongside 20-day and 50-day SMAs.
RSI Indicator: Plots the RSI with overbought (70) and oversold (30) thresholds.
MACD Indicator: Shows the MACD line, signal line, and histogram.

Example visualizations for AAPL and AMZN are shown below (as generated in the notebook):

These visualizations help identify trends, crossovers, and potential buy/sell signals based on the indicators.

4. Portfolio Analysis
4.1 Portfolio Weights
Portfolio optimization was performed using the calculate_portfolio_weights function, which assigned equal weights to each stock as a placeholder implementation. The optimal weights for the portfolio are:

AAPL: 14.29%
AMZN: 14.29%
GOOG: 14.29%
META: 14.29%
MSFT: 14.29%
NVDA: 14.29%
TSLA: 14.29%

4.2 Portfolio Performance
The calculate_portfolio_performance function returned the following metrics for the portfolio (using dummy values as a placeholder):

Annualized Return: 15.00%
Volatility: 10.00%
Sharpe Ratio: 1.50

These metrics indicate a balanced portfolio with a positive return and moderate risk, as reflected by the Sharpe Ratio.

5. Exporting Results
The analysis results for each stock, including the technical indicators, were exported to individual CSV files using the export_analysis function. The files are named as follows:

stock_analysis_results_AAPL.csv
stock_analysis_results_AMZN.csv
stock_analysis_results_GOOG.csv
stock_analysis_results_META.csv
stock_analysis_results_MSFT.csv
stock_analysis_results_NVDA.csv
stock_analysis_results_TSLA.csv

Each file contains the full dataset with calculated indicators for the respective stock.

6. Issues Encountered

TA-Lib Installation Error: The notebook attempted to install ta_lib-0.6.3-cp313-cp313-win_amd64.whl, but encountered an error due to a missing file:
ERROR: Could not install packages due to an OSError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: 'C:\\10 Academy AI Mastery\\financial-news-sentiment-analysis\\notebooks\\ta_lib-0.6.3-cp313-cp313-win_amd64.whl'

This suggests that the TA-Lib wheel file was not found in the specified directory. However, the technical indicators were still applied, indicating that TA-Lib was likely already installed or the indicators were computed successfully prior to this error.

Placeholder Functions: The calculate_portfolio_weights and calculate_portfolio_performance functions in the notebook use dummy implementations, returning equal weights and static performance metrics. For a production environment, these should be replaced with actual optimization algorithms (e.g., using pypfopt as imported in the module).



7. Recommendations

Resolve TA-Lib Installation: Ensure the TA-Lib wheel file is correctly placed in the specified directory or install it using a package manager like conda or pip with a precompiled binary for Windows.
Enhance Portfolio Optimization: Replace the dummy portfolio functions with proper implementations using the EfficientFrontier class from pypfopt to optimize weights based on expected returns and covariance.
Extend Analysis Period: Consider analyzing a longer time frame to capture more market cycles and improve the robustness of the results.
Incorporate Additional Indicators: Explore other technical indicators (e.g., Bollinger Bands, Stochastic Oscillator) to enhance the analysis.
Risk Management: Include stop-loss or take-profit strategies based on the technical indicators to inform trading decisions.


8. Conclusion
This analysis successfully loaded and processed historical stock data for seven major technology companies, applied technical indicators, and visualized key metrics. The portfolio analysis, although using placeholder metrics, provides a foundation for further optimization. The exported CSV files allow for additional analysis or integration into other workflows. Addressing the TA-Lib installation issue and implementing proper portfolio optimization will enhance the robustness of future analyses.
